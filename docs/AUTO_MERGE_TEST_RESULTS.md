## How Auto-Merge Will Work

When Dependabot creates a new PR:

1. **Workflow Triggers**
   - Both auto-merge workflows will run
   - They check the update type and dependency

2. **For Eligible Updates**
   - PR is automatically approved
   - Auto-merge is enabled on the PR
   - PR merges when all CI checks pass

3. **For Non-Eligible Updates**
   - PR is labeled "requires-manual-review"
   - Comment explains why manual review is needed
   - You manually review and merge

## Testing Auto-Merge

### Option 1: Wait for Next Dependabot Update
Dependabot runs daily at 06:00 UTC. When it creates a PR:
- Check the PR page for auto-merge status
- Look for the bot's approval
- Monitor the Actions tab

### Option 2: Trigger Dependabot Manually
You can trigger Dependabot to check for updates now:
1. Go to Insights → Dependency graph → Dependabot
2. Click "Check for updates"

### Option 3: Create a Test Scenario
Add an outdated dev dependency to test:
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "prettier": "^2.0.0"  // Current is 3.x
  }
}
```

## Monitoring Auto-Merge

### Where to Check:
1. **Pull Requests Tab**
   - Look for auto-merge icon
   - Check labels: "auto-merge-enabled"

2. **Actions Tab**
   - "Dependabot Auto-Merge" workflows
   - Check run logs for decisions

3. **PR Comments**
   - Bot comments explain merge decisions
   - Shows why PR was/wasn't auto-merged

## Current Status

The auto-merge system is now fully configured and waiting for Dependabot PRs. Since you've enabled auto-merge in GitHub settings, the next Dependabot PR should automatically:

1. Trigger the auto-merge workflows
2. Get evaluated based on update type
3. Auto-merge if it meets the criteria

## Next Dependabot Run

Dependabot is scheduled to run:
- **Time**: Daily at 06:00 UTC
- **Package ecosystems**: npm, GitHub Actions, Docker, pip

When it runs, any patch updates or minor dev dependency updates will automatically merge!
